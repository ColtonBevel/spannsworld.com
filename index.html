            <p>I am Spann Cordle, I made history when I successfully pioneered Walmart’s first associate service dog team, making possible jobs for hundreds of disabled persons. Living with CP, I have become a nationally known spokesperson for disabled persons in the workplace.</p>

            <p>Artificial Intelligence appears to be the next coming form or revelation aimed at helping the disabled in a mechanical infused environment.

                    <p>
                        Kay Willingham Shiver, former Editor of Career Pilot Magazine, is an award-winning writer, photographer, and journalist. Prior to her time at Career Pilot, she was News Editor and Principal Photographer for the Office of Public Relations for Berry College. While on staff at Berry College, she was responsible for all press releases, media coverage, and alumni publications. During this time, she was named “Woman of Achievement” by the Chattooga County Business and Professional Women. She began her journalism career as a reporter and feature writer at The Summerville News, where her reporting on local schools was given statewide recognition with four consecutive Georgia School Bell Awards by the Georgia Association of Educators. In addition to writing and photography, Mrs. Shiver enjoys teaching and served 20 years as a volunteer AWANA leader, teaching hundreds of students in grades K-12.

                        <br>
                        She most recently has covered the ongoing story of Disability Advocate Spann Cordle, writing for numerous publications, including a chapter in the recently released Second Edition of God’s Junkman by John Charles Turner. Cordle has garnered attention on a national level for his pioneering efforts in service dog teams in the workplace. His story has become intertwined with his hometown of Summerville, its Mainstreet revitalization, revered and acclaimed folk artist, the late Reverend Howard Finster, the work of local artist Billy Smith, and their former teacher and mentor John Turner. Turner’s “World Friendship Project” has resulted in the publication of the Second Edition of God’s Junkman, which includes the story of Turner’s former student, Spann Cordle.
